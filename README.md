# DarkGDK-Revive-Project
This are work samples me working with DarkGDK(Development Kit for Games)

Project Goal: Refresh my skills with the DarkGDK(Development Kit for Games)

What is the value of this project? 
Previously I worked on DarkGdk back around 2009 when it was popular this is a very rare development kit for games but can still be applied today as its a Development kit for Games 
as supposed to just a Game Engine. This project was also good for keeping my coding skills in relation to games sharp as this C++ strictly in relation to games which can be
applied to any development kit for games. Also Visual Studio 2008 is still used to complie and load toady's games on PC and Consoles still use development kits for games.

What did I learn that was new?
I learned more about adding additional files to the C++ debug and linker I also learned about creating templates through the use of file transfers to speed up development time
